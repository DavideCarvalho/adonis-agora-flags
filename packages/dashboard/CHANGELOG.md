## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agora-flags/pull/2) [`6a28271`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agora-flags/commit/6a28271c96f51c0ff33882ee85191c517ccfdbe7) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Mark the flags packages as an independent release line (`agora.versioning: 'independent'`), so `agora:doctor` no longer warns that 0.x flags is mixed with the 1.x Agora libs.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c39f892`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agora-flags/commit/c39f892efba4efbb13a296978619939a6911adf5) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - First release: typed feature flags with targeting, percentage rollouts and a kill switch; experiments with exposures, conversions, SRM, CUPED and sequential tests; transports (db, Redis), sinks (Lucid, Parquet/DuckDB, ClickHouse, PostHog); flags created and edited from the console; a central control-plane with tenant apps, authkit tokens, a browser API and OFREP; authkit identities as subjects; an OpenFeature provider; React bindings that read from the Adonis backend or straight from the flags server.
