`transports.queue()`: deliver events as `@adonisjs/queue` jobs (new optional peer, `>=0.7.0 <1.0.0`). Each batch becomes one job per sink, run by `node ace queue:work` with the queue's retries and backoff, so a failing sink retries on its own. No relay and no replay (`flags:replay`), not transactional. The console's Ops page shows the sinks as delivered by the transport's jobs instead of "no relay".
